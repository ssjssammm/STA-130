    "→ How does the nature of concerns during health checkups and the depth of the concern and analysis impact the patient’s  likelihood of return  and/or frequency of visitation to their healthcare providers (2 levels of depth 1: being asked about the topic, 2: being given advice about the topic)\n",
    "→ Variables:\n",
    "When was the last time you visited a healthcare provider?\n",
    "Do you have a primary healthcare provider?\n",
    "Last time you visited a healthcare provider, did they: [Ask you about using alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs], [Ask you about your diet], [Ask you about physical activity]\n",

    "The hypothesis would be that people who have had specific healthcare topics drawn to their attention might have a longer time between their last visit when compared to people who did not. \n",

[coworkers], [strangers], To what extent are you currently following the COVID-19 prevention practices listed below? [wear a mask in public], [Physically distance yourself by 2 metres from others] These variables were chosen to directly compare desired socializing time with likelihood to wear masks and to isolate (since these were the covid restrictions that most limited interaction).\n",

I chose these variables because I wanted to analyze if there is a direct association between the number of friends that an individual has, and their level of access to opportunities.\n",
